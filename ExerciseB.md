# Exercise B
## For C# / Selenium

### **Exercise B - Create a Repository for the C# / Selenium code and import the files**
As for the 'Cookie Object' code, the C# / Selenium Code will need to go into GitHub, so that it can be worked on further.

#### 1. Create a New Repository in GitHub
1. Create a new, public repository, "cs-selenium-tute"
1. Set a gitignore file.  Choose type, "Visual Studio"
  1. This should exclude build products and 'internal', hidden visual studio files from the repository

#### 2. Clone / Checkout the New, Empty Repository to your PC
This step assumes that :
* all instances of Visual Studio are closed on your PC
* In a web browser, you are logged into your GitHub account and are in the top-level of the new repository
* Visual Studio has the Git / GitHub plugins and support installed

1. Open Visual Studio (do not open existing project)
1. You should be presented with a splash screen, whereby one can open a recent project, or a number of other actions under "Get Started"
1. Choose "Clone or check out code"
1. In the browser, click the "Clone or download" button (right of screen, above the area that lists the repo's files)
1. Click the copy button to get the URL of the repo
1. Paste this into the "Repository Location" text box (in the open Clone or Checkout Code dialogue) in Visual Studio
1. Ensure the destination folder is of the form: Users\{YOUR_USER_NAME}\source\repos\cs-selenium-tute
1. Click the "Clone" button in Visual Studio

#### 3. Add files to the new local copy of cs-selenium-tute
1. Copy Contents of the Original C# / Selenium Solution Folder into the new cs-selenium-tute folder
2. Ensure the project / solution builds OK

#### 4. Commits / Pushes from Visual Studio
1. With the cloned cs-selenium-tute open in Visual Studio:
1. Ensure the "Team Explorer" pane is open in Visual Studio
1. Click the Home button in the Team Explorer Pane
1. Click the "Changes" button under "Project" in the Team Explorer Pane
1. Add a commit message (e.g.: initial commit)
1. Click the "Commit All" button
1. Note the message in Visual Studio Team Explorer
1. Try to 'Sync' changes with the (GitHub) server
